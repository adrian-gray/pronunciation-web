    <p>
      Is poor English pronunciation holding you back in your career or studies? Do you want to improve your spoken English, but are not sure how? Help is on the way!
    </p>
    <p>
      We are currently producing over 60 videos lessons to help you improve your spoken English. The videos feature Nicky Brooks, a professional English language consultant, giving English language pronunciation lessons made for this site. She teaches how to make the sounds used in English, how to understand English sounds, and how to improve your accent in English.

      Following the pronunciation lessons are English pronunciation examples, recorded conversations, and interactive activities to help improve your pronunciation the right way. We are currently adding sounds and activities weekly. Improve your English pronunciation to speak clearly and professionally.
