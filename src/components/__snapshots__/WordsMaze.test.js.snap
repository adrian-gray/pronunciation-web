      Discover your way through the maze. Find the words that share the bob sound and travel along the path of the maze from one word to the next until you discover the way out. Master each level and advance to the next – more complex words, more twists and turns. Maze is an interactive pronunciation game that helps you become familiar with common English words so you can speak with confidence.
